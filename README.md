### Functions/Modules Description

The following details the purpose, goals, and significance of the `data_flow_generator` function and its constituent components:

`data_flow_generator`
------------------------

Description: This Python function utilizes the Streamlit library to generate detailed and structured documentation for uploaded Python code. The application aims to simplify key processes, provide an efficient and reliable solution, and offer a user-friendly interface for developers and end-users.

### Main Features

The code highlights the following key features and capabilities:

*   **Core functionalities:** The `data_flow_generator` function extracts the Python code from the uploaded ZIP file and uses it to generate a Data Flow Chart using Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs). The chart is then rendered using Graphviz.
*   **Advanced or unique features:** This application incorporates a custom prompt that guides users through a step-by-step process for generating documentation. The application also includes parameter handling and error checking to ensure robustness and reliability.
*   **Benefits or enhancements over alternatives:** The code achieves improved documentation quality compared to alternative tools, offering a more comprehensive and practical approach to generating documentation.

### Parameters

The following parameters are defined for the `data_flow_generator` function:

| Parameter Name | Data Type | Purpose | Attributes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `upload_file` | `st.File` | Python file uploads | `upload_file` is the uploaded ZIP file containing the Python code. |
| `output_dir` | `str` | Directory path for the generated documentation | `output_dir` is the directory path where the generated documentation will be saved. |

### Attributes

The following attributes are documented for the `data_flow_generator` function:

| Attribute Name | Data Type | Purpose | Attributes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `root_dir` | `str` | Root directory of the project | `root_dir` is the root directory of the project where the extracted files are stored. |
| ` uploaded_code_folder` | `dict` | Folder containing the uploaded Python code | `uploaded_code_folder` is a dictionary object storing the extracted data in the uploaded file. |
| `data_flow_chart_filename` | `str` | Filename of the generated Data Flow Chart | `data_flow_chart_filename` is the filename for the generated Data Flow Chart in Markdown format. |

### Methods

The `data_flow_generator` function includes the following methods:

| Method Name | Description | Parameters | Return Type | Exceptions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `main()` | Essential function that starts the application | `upload_file` | `None` | No exceptions |
| `get_input_file()` | Retrieves the uploaded file object | `upload_file` | `File` object | No exceptions |
| `process_input_file()` | Processes the uploaded file to extract code and generates the Data Flow Chart | `upload_file` | `File` object | No exceptions |
| `render_documentation()` | Renders the generated documentation as Markdown file | `data_flow_chart_filename` | `str` | No exceptions |

### Examples and Use Cases

The application provides the following examples and use cases for practical scenarios:

**Example 1:** Upload a ZIP file containing Python code, generate the documentation using the `data_flow_generator` function, and download the generated markdown file.
```python
import os
import tempfile
import streamlit as st
from data_flow_generator import data_flow_generator

.upload_file = 'path/to/uploaded/code.zip'
output_dir = os.path.join(tempfile.gettempdir(), 'uploaded_code')
data_flow_generator(upload_file, output_dir)
```
**Example 2:** Upload a ZIP file without a Python file containing code, and display an error message indicating that no code was found.
```python
import os
import tempfile
import streamlit as st
from data_flow_generator import data_flow_generator

.upload_file = ''
output_dir = os.path.join(tempfile.gettempdir(), 'uploaded_code')
data_flow_generator(upload_file, output_dir)
```
**Use Cases:** Developers and end-users can use the `data_flow_generator` function to simplify the process of generating documentation for their Python code. By providing a step-by-step guide for generating documentation and including practical examples, the application aims to improve the overall user experience and encourage users to use the application efficiently.

### Practical Example: Generate Documentation for a Python Code

*   Upload a ZIP file containing Python code using the `upload_file` parameter.
*   Set the `output_dir` parameter to the directory where the documentation should be saved.
*   Run the `data_flow_generator` function to generate the documentation.
*   Download the generated Markdown file using the `data_flow_chart_filename` parameter.

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1.  Upload a ZIP file containing Python code to the application using the `upload_file` parameter.
2.  Set the `output_dir` parameter to the directory where the documentation should be saved.
3.  Run the `data_flow_generator` function using the `data_flow_chart_filename` parameter.

### Results

The generated documentation will be saved in the specified directory. The Markdown file can be downloaded using the `data_flow_chart_filename` parameter.

### Inherited Members

The `data_flow_generator` function inherits from the `Streamlit App` class, providing a basic structure and templates for the application. The application also uses the `groq` library for API interactions, which adds an additional layer of functionality for generating documentation based on user-generated content.

### Side Effects

The application has no explicit side effects, except that the generated markdown file may require manual handling depending on the user's library environment. The application assumes that the project has the necessary dependencies installed and set up as expected.
